# Modulo 1 - evaluaci√≥n final - marcjnn

I created this page during the final exam after module I (HTML & CSS) at [Adalab](https://adalab.es/) bootcamp. The task was to build a landing page based on a given design, for three different screen sizes.

**Used tools:**

- [Adalab Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/Adalab/Adalab-web-starter-kit)
- HTML5, CSS3 (including flexbox, grid, media queries, basic transitions & animations)
- Sass (SCSS): html & css partials, scss nesting, mixins, variables,
- npm, gulp, github, github pages

You can see the final resault [here](http://beta.adalab.es/modulo-1-evaluacion-final-marcjnn/).
